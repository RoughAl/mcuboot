RELEASE VERSION 1.0
Release Notes

Welcome to the first release of MCUBoot, a secure bootloader for 32-bit MCUs. It is designed to be operating 
system-agnostic and works over any transport - wired or wireless. It is also hardware independent, and relies 
on hardware porting layers from the operating system it works with. For the first release, we are pleased to 
announce support for three open source operating systems - Apache Mynewt, Zephyr Project, and Riot OS.
